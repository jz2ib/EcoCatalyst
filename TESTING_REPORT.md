# EcoCatalyst Testing Report

## Summary
This report documents the testing efforts for the EcoCatalyst mobile application, including both automated and manual testing approaches. Several issues were identified that prevented comprehensive testing in the current environment.

## Automated Testing Issues

### Jest Configuration Issues
- **Error**: TypeScript syntax errors in React Native dependencies
  ```
  SyntaxError: /home/ubuntu/repos/EcoCatalyst/apps/mobile/EcoCatalystApp/node_modules/@react-native/js-polyfills/error-guard.js: Missing semicolon. (14:4)
  type ErrorHandler = (error: mixed, isFatal: boolean) => void;
  ```
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  1. Updated jest.config.js with proper coverage settings
  2. Added explicit imports from @jest/globals in jest.setup.js
  3. Modified transformIgnorePatterns to handle React Native dependencies
  4. Added proper TypeScript annotations to mock implementations

### Current Test Coverage
- Current test coverage is estimated at <10% (target: 80%)
- Many components and contexts lack unit tests
- Existing tests have configuration issues preventing them from running

## Manual Testing Issues

### Web Version Issues
- **Error**: Bundling error in Expo development server
  ```
  Unable to resolve "react-native-web/dist/exports/useColorScheme" from "src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx"
  ```
- The web version of the app fails to load due to compatibility issues with react-native-web

### Mobile Testing Requirements
- Manual testing plan requires Expo Go on a mobile device or emulator
- Current environment limitations prevent testing on physical devices

## Recommendations

### For Automated Testing
1. **Update Dependencies**: Resolve version conflicts between React, React Native, and testing libraries
2. **Fix Jest Configuration**: 
   - Update babel configuration to properly handle TypeScript in React Native
   - Ensure proper mocking of native modules
3. **Implement Unit Tests**: Create tests for all components and contexts following existing patterns

### For Manual Testing
1. **Setup Mobile Environment**: Configure Android/iOS emulator for testing
2. **Use Expo Go**: Test with Expo Go as specified in the manual testing plan
3. **Follow Test Cases**: Execute test cases from MANUAL_TESTING.md systematically

## Next Steps
1. Address Jest configuration issues to enable automated testing
2. Create a comprehensive list of components and contexts requiring tests
3. Implement unit tests for core components to increase coverage
4. Setup proper environment for manual testing with Expo Go
